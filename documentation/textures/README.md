# Textures

A **texture** is a two-dimensional [raster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) image in the context of a game engine. Textures in Source are stored in the [Valve Texture Format](valve-texture-format-vtf/), and with a very few exceptions are only accessed through an intermediate [material](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Material).

While the most common type of texture is the [albedo](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Albedo), there are many different uses for raster images in modern game engines. For instance [bump maps](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Bump_map), which encode three-dimensional height and facing in the color value of each pixel, or [specular masks](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/$envmapmask), which determine the intensity of a [specular](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/$envmap) reflection.
