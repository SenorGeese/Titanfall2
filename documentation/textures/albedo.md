# Albedo

An albedo \(sometimes diffuse map\) is a [texture ](./)containing view-independent color information. It is what we normally think of a texture as being, as opposed to 'treatment' textures like bump maps or specular masks.

Albedos are referenced in [materials ](valve-material-type-vmt.md)with the [`$basetexture`](shader/usdbasetexture.md) command.
