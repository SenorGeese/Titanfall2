# Exporting using Legion

### Download and Setup

If you have not downloaded and set up Legion, you can find it on the Modding tools page:

{% content-ref url="../start-modding/modding-intro/tools/" %}
[tools](../start-modding/modding-intro/tools/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### How to Use

After you have set up Legion, open the `Legion.exe` file to start.

#### Extracting images, materials, textures from .rpaks

To extract images, materials, etc., click the "Load File" in the bottom left and navigate to`\Titanfall2\r2\paks\Win64`. The most commonly used rpak is `common.rpak`. \
After you open the rpak file, the Legion window should show a list of files. Double-click the files you want to extract, and they will automatically be extracted to `\Legion\exported_files\`. You can also use "Export Selected" and "Export All" to extract files. If you need help finding something there is a "Search" on the top right.

#### "Titanfall 2" button

Clicking the `Titanfall 2` button will open a window prompting you to drop a `.mdl` file to convert. This will convert the file into seperate 3D Object files (`.obj`). Note that not every export format has been tested for Titanfall 2. Semodel's have been tested but requires Blender 2.79 to use BUT you can export as .obj which then you can use newer Blender versions. You can change export format in "Settings".
