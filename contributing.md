# Contributing

Anyone is more than welcome to contribute to this wiki. If you would like to contribute new information or guides, please ask one of the [main editors](contributors.md#admins-main-editors) on our Discord server for editing access.

### A few things to keep in mind

* When requesting editing access please describe what it is that you would like to contribute.
* Please take time to proofread and fact-check your content before submitting to make sure it has the least amount of errors.
* Submissions can be denied if we feel it does not fit or has inaccurate information. We will generally tell you why it is rejected though or ask for revisions.

**IT'S JUST A TYPO!**

If you would like to report a minor error in the guide (a typo, inaccurate information, etc.) you don't need to request editing access. Instead you can just send us a message and tag **@Frontier Militia** on Discord to notify any available editors to make the change.
{% endhint %}
