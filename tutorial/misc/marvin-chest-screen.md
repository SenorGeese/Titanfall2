# Marvin - Chest screen

## Preparation <a id="preparation"></a>

In this guide you will have to edit vmt files. I would recommend you to use the software [VTFEdit](https://noskill.gitbook.io/titanfall2/how-to-start-modding/modding-tools) to edit them. You can use text editor for that such as Atom, NotePad++, VIM and many other ones would work fine.

Navigate to your folder and find this VPK file:

> Origin Games\Titanfall2\vpk\

Copy these file and paste them in an empty folder somewhere else:

* englishclient\_mp\_common.bsp.pak000\_dir.vpk
* client\_mp\_common.bsp.pak000\_000.vpk

You will need the Titanfall VPK Tool, the program which will allow you to open and repack Titanfall VPK files. [Here](https://noskill.gitbook.io/titanfall2/how-to-start-modding/modding-tools)​

## Unpacking <a id="unpacking"></a>

Now that these files have been backed up and everything installed. Navigate to your game folder and open this file:

> Origin Games\Titanfall2\vpk\englishclient\_mp\_common.bsp.pak000\_dir.vpk

## Editing

To edit marvin screen chest, go to this location

> materials\models\robots\marvin

The file _`marvin_face_happy.vtf`_ and / or _`marvin_face_sad`_ can be replaced with any picture, their size have to be **128x128**.

After following step by step the previous link

Rename pak000\_000.vpk _to_ **client\_mp\_common.bsp.pak000\_000.vpk**

Rename pak000\_dir.vpk _to_ **englishclient\_mp\_common.bsp.pak000\_dir.vpk**

Place both of the renamed files back into your game directory and then launch Titanfall 2. You should be able to see your new crosshair!
