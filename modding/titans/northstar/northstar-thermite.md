# Northstar - Thermite

## Preparation

In those "guide" called premade I will consider that you know how to properly setup / start modding your game. If it's not your case you must read the "General info", refer to this [link](https://noskill.gitbook.io/titanfall2/how-to-start-modding/modding-introduction)

Any suggestion are welcome, you can submit your request / idea on NS Discord or even if you made your own premade weapon / set. You can reach me via [contact](https://noskill.gitbook.io/titanfall2/contact) details.
