# Getting a Model into Blender

## This is new.

This is a experimental Documentation/Video Mix concept. This is designed to provide the depth/detail that a video can provide while providing a document to follow along which explains parts of the video in text or provide necessary links.&#x20;

Yes this is like Khan Academy. Give me feedback on this idea. I wish this would become a sort of video hoster concept. Maybe, if this is a success.
