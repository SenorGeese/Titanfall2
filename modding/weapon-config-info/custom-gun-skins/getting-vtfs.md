# Getting Custom Skin files

### Getting Files

There are several ways to obtain files for custom skins.

#### NoSkill Discord Server's #custom-skins channel.

You can get community-created skin's from our discord server NoSkill. Here at [https://discord.gg/sEgmTKg](https://discord.gg/sEgmTKg).

#### Asking anyone with a custom skin or in Modding Titanfall 2 servers

If you ask around in NoSkill or other Titanfall 2 modding servers, you may be find someone willing to share their skins or direct you to some.

#### VTFEdit

For VTF format. You could also input an image into VTFEdit for a skin, but it may not be the most accurate.&#x20;

#### Making them

The most daring option would be making your own skin from scratch. It will be time consuming if you are new to the process, but you can create whatever your mind desires to use. Check this page for tips on making your own skin:
