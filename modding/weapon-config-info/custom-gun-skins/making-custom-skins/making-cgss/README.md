AutoHotkey is used by many to create custom keybind macro. Usually using a numpad as the macro start key. Find their website and info at [by clicking these words](https://www.autohotkey.com). As coding goes, there is many ways to code macros. Personally i use the code below to refresh Photoshop file to update the skin in Blender;

```
Numpad1::send {ctrl down}{s down}{ctrl up}{s up}
Numpad3::send {alt down}{r down}{alt up}{r up}
Numpad2::send {ctrl down}{z down}{ctrl up}{z up}
]::Suspend
\::ExitApp
```

* Numpad1: Saves (CTRL+S)
* Numpad2: Undo (CTRL+Z)
* Numpad3: Reloads images in Blender with NodeWrangler (ALT+R)&#x20;
