# Getting Custom Skin files

### Getting Files

There are several ways to obtain files for custom skins.

#### Custom Skin Gallery Info and Files

You can get community-created skin's from the gallery. Here in Gitbook we will be showcasing and sharing files of skins that are posted in the NoSkill server:

{% page-ref page="../cgs-gallery.md" %}

#### Asking anyone with a custom skin or in Modding Titanfall 2 servers

If you ask around in NoSkill or other Titanfall 2 modding servers, you may be find someone willing to share their skins or direct you to some.

#### VTFEdit

You could also input an image into VTFEdit for a skin, but it may not be the most accurate.

#### Making them

The most daring option would be making your own skin from scratch. It will be time consuming if you are new to the process, but you can create whatever your mind desires to use. Check this page for tips on making your own skin:
