# VTF文件制作

### Getting VTF's

There are several ways to obtain VTF's for custom skins:

#### Custom Skin Gallery Info and Files

You can get community-created vtf's from the gallery. Here in Gitbook we will be showcasing and sharing files of skins that are posted in the NoSkill server:

#### Asking anyone with a custom skin or in Modded Titanfall 2 servers

If you ask around on NoSkill or other Titanfall 2 modding servers, you may be find someone willing to share their vtf's or direct you to some.

#### VTFEdit

You could also input an image into VTFEdit for a skin, but it may not be the most accurate.

#### Making them

The last option would be making your own skin from scratch. It will be time consuming if you are new to the process, but can create whatever your mind desires to use. Check this page for tips on making your own skin:
