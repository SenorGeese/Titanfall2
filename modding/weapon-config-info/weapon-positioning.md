# Weapon Positioning

## Preparation

Locate your game folder and find this folder if you are on Origin:

> Origin Games\Titanfall2\vpk\\

Or this folder if you are on Steam:

> Steam\steamapps\common\Titanfall2\vpk\\

Copy these files and paste them in a backup folder somewhere else:

* `englishclient_mp_common.bsp.pak000_dir.vpk`
* `client_mp_common.bsp.pak000_000.vpk`

You will need the Titanfall VPK Tool, the program which will allow you to open and repack Titanfall VPK files. [Here](https://noskill.gitbook.io/titanfall2/how-to-start-modding/modding-tools)

## Unpacking

Now that these files have been backed up and everything installed. Navigate to your game folder and open this file:

> Origin Games\Titanfall2\vpk\englishclient\_mp\_common.bsp.pak000\_dir.vpk

## Editing

Navigate to this location in your extracted folder

> \scripts\weapons

This folder contains the "config files" for the weapons. Edit those files at your own risk, if you get banned because you edit some important value donâ€™t blame me.

Find this part of code in the file:

```
MP_BASE
	{
```

You want to add the following command in there:

```
"viewmodel_offset_hip" 						"x z y"
```

So it should look like this:

```
MP_BASE
	{	"viewmodel_offset_hip" 						"x z y" 
```

### Position Values

The Standard value for each of the coordinates is "0".

A positive "X" value is going to move the gun to the right, a negative one to the left.

A positive "Z" value is going to move the gun Forwards, a negative one backwards.

A positive "Y" value is going to move the gun up, a negative one down.

### Examples

!["viewmodel\_offset\_hip" 						"-10 0 -3"](<../../.gitbook/assets/another kraber edit.jpg>)

!["viewmodel\_offset\_hip" 						"2 -2 -3"](<../../.gitbook/assets/Desktop Screenshot 2020.03.04 - 16.25.20.77.png>)

!["viewmodel\_offset\_hip" 						"-6.5 1 -4"](<../../.gitbook/assets/Desktop Screenshot 2020.03.04 - 16.47.10.40.png>)

## Repacking

[How to repack VPK files properly?](https://noskill.gitbook.io/titanfall2/how-to-start-modding/how-to-backup-extract-and-repack#how-to-repack-vpk-files-properly)

After closely following the previous link step by step:

Rename `pak000_000.vpk` _to_ `client_mp_common.bsp.pak000_000.vpk`

Rename `pak000_dir.vpk` _to_ `englishclient_mp_common.bsp.pak000_dir.vpk`

Place both of the renamed files back into your game directory and then launch Titanfall 2. You should be able to see your new weapon position!
