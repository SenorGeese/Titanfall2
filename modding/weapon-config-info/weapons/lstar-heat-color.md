# LSTAR - Heat color

## Preparation <a id="preparation"></a>

In this guide you will have to edit vmt files. I would recommend you to use the software [VTFEdit](https://noskill.gitbook.io/titanfall2/how-to-start-modding/modding-tools) to edit them. You can use text editor for that such as Atom, NotePad++, VIM and many other ones would work fine.

Navigate to your folder and find this VPK file:

> Origin Games\Titanfall2\vpk\

Copy these file and paste them in an empty folder somewhere else:

* englishclient\_mp\_common.bsp.pak000\_dir.vpk
* client\_mp\_common.bsp.pak000\_000.vpk

You will need the Titanfall VPK Tool, the program which will allow you to open and repack Titanfall VPK files. [Here](https://noskill.gitbook.io/titanfall2/how-to-start-modding/modding-tools)​

## Unpacking <a id="unpacking"></a>

Now that these files have been backed up and everything installed. Navigate to your game folder and open this file:

> Origin Games\Titanfall2\vpk\englishclient\_mp\_common.bsp.pak000\_dir.vpk

## Editing <a id="editing"></a>

To edit the following weapon heat effect you need to find their .vmt files. Further in this guide you will find the different file locations and details about what modifications can be done.

You can edit the heat color, [here](https://noskill.gitbook.io/titanfall2/information/color-and-texture-info#usdlayercolor) more information about color and how to edit the way you like.

You can change the heat effect texture to any other texture in the game. Some texture would work, some wouldn't look good and some other texture would just not work. More info [here](https://noskill.gitbook.io/titanfall2/information/color-and-texture-info#usdtexture2-and-usdbasetexture) how to edit the texture value.

​[How to repack VPK files proprely ?](https://noskill.gitbook.io/titanfall2/how-to-start-modding/how-to-backup-extract-and-repack)​

After following step by step the previous link

Rename pak000\_000.vpk _to_ **client\_mp\_common.bsp.pak000\_000.vpk**

Rename pak000\_dir.vpk _to_ **englishclient\_mp\_common.bsp.pak000\_dir.vpk**

Place both of the renamed files back into your game directory and then launch Titanfall 2. You should be able to see your new crosshair!
