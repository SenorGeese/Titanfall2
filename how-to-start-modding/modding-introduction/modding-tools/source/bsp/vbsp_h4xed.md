# VBSP\_h4xed

A modified version of [VBSP](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Vbsp) designed to greatly increase the maximum width and length of [visleaves](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Visleaf). It was designed by [DeathByNukes](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/User:DeathByNukes) to speed up the compile of large empty maps for [Garry's Mod](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Garry%27s_Mod) and to give mappers greater control of a level's optimization.

Some of its uses have been obsoleted by [func\_viscluster](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Func_viscluster).
