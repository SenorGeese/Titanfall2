# BSPSource

 **BSPSource** is a [VMEX](vmex.md)-based map decompiler for the [Source](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source) engine. It converts [BSP](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/BSP) format files back into [VMF](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VMF) format maps that can be loaded into [Hammer](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Hammer). Support has been extended to newer Source games, such as [![&amp;lt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&amp;gt;](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/w/images/3/35/Csgo.png)](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive) [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive), [![&amp;lt;Left 4 Dead 2&amp;gt;](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/w/images/9/93/L4D2-16px.png)](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Left_4_Dead_2) [Left 4 Dead 2](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Left_4_Dead_2), and [![\[Portal 2\]](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/w/images/7/77/Portal2-16px.png)](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Portal_2) [Portal 2](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Portal_2). Most of the bugs found in the latest release of VMEX have been fixed, and new features have been added.

Some of its features are:

* Extracting embedded content \(protected maps may cause errors\)
* BSP analysis
* Support for processing multiple files at once
* Convenient BSP file Drag & Drop
* Much more!

 **Note:**Decompiling maps may not always result in accurate builds. Some properties, such as keyvalues and texture settings, may not match those of the original map. A common example \(bug\) are misplaced [areaportals](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Areaportal).
