# BSP Viewer

**BSP Viewer** is a utility by [Nem](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/User:Nem) that allows you to view and export [Goldsource](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Goldsource) maps. Goldsource maps do not contain as much information about brushwork as [Source](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source) maps do, so Nem chose to construct a brush for every polygon on the map by creating a 1 unit thick wall.
