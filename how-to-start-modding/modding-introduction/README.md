# 修改指南

## First step

Before getting into Titanfall 2 modding, you should backup any [VPK ](../../information/file-format/vpk-valve-pak-file.md)files that you will get into, if you mess up or your [VPK ](../../information/file-format/vpk-valve-pak-file.md)files get corrupted you don't need to download or repair your game from Origin because you will learn how to make a backup

In this guide, the location of each [VPK ](../../information/file-format/vpk-valve-pak-file.md)file will be listed at the beginning of the page.
